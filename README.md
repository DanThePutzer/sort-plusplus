# SortPlusPlus

Implementing various sort algorithms in C++ to practice.

The goal is to get familiar with the language as well as the file structure of projects, common errors and how to make things run efficiently.

## Installation

This code is being developed in Visual Studio Community 2019 and, therefore has a project structure with files specific to Visual Studio. The raw C++ code can be found in the **/src** directory, so feel free to use your IDE of choice. As the purpose of this little exercise is to write some simple algorithms from scratch, there are no dependencies you need to install.

## Usage

To be able to run the code, you'll need to compile it yourself. This should be fairly easy in any IDE.
