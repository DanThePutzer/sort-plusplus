# sort-plusplus

A collection of popular sorting algorithms implemented in C++ as a first little practice exercise to get familiar with the basics of the language. After working with lots of fairly high-level languages (JavaScript, Python etc.) I wanted to dig a little deeper and work my way into native languages. Given that I am always looking to get deeper into machine learning and AI, C++ was a great candidate. Many Python packages and deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow are written in C++.

### Implemented Algorithms

Currently the following sorting algorithms have been implemented and documented:

- **QuickSort**
- **MergeSort**
- **BubbleSort**

All are working in-place without auxiliary arrays.

## Installation

This code is being developed in Visual Studio Community 2019 and, therefore, has a project structure with files specific to Visual Studio. The raw C++ code can be found in the **/src** directory, so feel free to use your IDE of choice. As the purpose of this little exercise is to write some simple algorithms from scratch, there are no third-party dependencies.
